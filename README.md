# Waste Sorting Using Computer Vision  

## **Introduction**  
Waste management is crucial for sustainability, and improper waste sorting reduces recycling efficiency. This project automates the waste sorting process using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with transfer learning.  

## **Objective**  
To classify waste into six categories: plastic, glass, paper, metal, shoes, and clothes, leveraging a pre-trained ResNet50 model.

## **Dataset**  
- **Source:** The dataset is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).  
- **Structure:** Six categories with approximately 700â€“1000 images per class.  
- **Data Splitting:**  
  - Training: 70%  
  - Validation: 15%  
  - Testing: 15%
